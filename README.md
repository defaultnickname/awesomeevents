# Magic Events

Incomplete task of creating  MERP

## Installation

You need to install python packages from requirements.txt and create database from migrations

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

python manage.py migrate
```

## Usage

I didn't manage to create UI in time so API is the only thing working.

I was intending to use my past project to speed up developement of frontend. So things like: login, auth, register are reused in this project - but it does not matter because frontend is not fully implemented

## REST enpoints
```bash
api/events

api/user

api/bookings
```
One can also use django admin to manage events/users/bookings
